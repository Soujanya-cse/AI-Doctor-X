Displays a full-body human model with visible internal organs

Users can click on organs to detect and analyze diseases

Organs dynamically glow based on severity (Green → Yellow → Red)

✅ Advanced Augmented Reality (AR) Disease Walkthrough

Users scan a QR code to launch an AR experience

Life-sized 3D human model appears in the real world

Users can walk through, zoom in, and interact with the model

Dynamic disease growth over six months visible in AR mode

Organs pulse and darken based on severity progression

✅ AI-Powered Disease Detection & Progression Tracking

AI highlights affected organs in real time

Time Progression Button shows disease impact over six months

AI adjusts disease spread based on age, lifestyle, and genetics

Hyper-realistic organ deterioration animation

✅ Health Risk Alerts & Personalized AI Recommendations

Real-time AI-generated health risk assessment

AI provides preventive health advice & alerts

Critical condition alerts for early intervention

✅ Real-Time AI Chatbot for Medical Assistance

Users can chat with an AI-powered medical assistant

Optional feature: Book real-time doctor consultations

✅ Futuristic Gen-Z UI & Visual Effects

Neon-lit, glowing UI with smooth micro-interactions
