## 🌟 Features
### 🔬 AR-Powered Interactive Human Model
- View a **black-transparent 3D human model** on a **white background**.  
- Click on **organs** (heart, lungs, brain, etc.) to analyze **real-time disease progression**.  
- **Disease flows through the veins like water**, changing colors over **6 months** (Green → Yellow → Red).  
- AI simulates **treatment effects**, showing **recovery progression** dynamically.  

### 📱 Augmented Reality (AR) Mode
- Scan a **QR Code** to project a **life-sized AR human model** in your surroundings.  
- **Walk around the AR model**, zoom into **organs**, and see **disease spread in real time**.  
- **Experience disease healing & prediction** through interactive AR.  

### 🔍 AI-Powered Disease Prediction
- Users enter **age, health history, and symptoms**, and AI **predicts future diseases**.  
- AI provides **early warnings** and **prevention measures** based on real-world medical data.  
- Personalized **AI health recommendations** for **improving well-being**.  

### 🚀 3D Disease Flow & Progression
- Disease spreads **like water flowing through pipes** in a **realistic 3D simulation**.  
- Users can **select a disease** and watch **6-month progression effects** in real-time.  
- Healing Mode: **See how medication & lifestyle changes reverse** disease effects.  

### 🎨 Futuristic Gen-Z UI
- **Holographic buttons** and **glowing red/pink highlights** for a **futuristic user experience**.  
- **Smooth animations & micro-interactions** create a **next-gen medical tool**.
